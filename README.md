# Nature of Code

[*Nature of Code*](https://natureofcode.com/) is an incredible book written by Daniel Shiffman that teaches you some techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems.

This repository contains demos for the various demos I've built from scratch as I work through the book.

## Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev` or `npm run build`

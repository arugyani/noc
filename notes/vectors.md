# Vectors

This chapter goes over the *Euclidean vector*, a.k.a the *geometric vector* â€” defined as an entity that has both **magnitude** and **direction**.

A vector is typically drawn as an arrow. The vector's direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and its magnitude by the length of the arrow.
